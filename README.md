## Hi there, I'm Yuri

I'm a front-end developer currently learning and improving my basics
### I'm usually working with
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,ts,react,nextjs,tailwind,sass,figma)](https://skillicons.dev)

### I use these to improve my workflow daily
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=notion,obsidian,)](https://skillicons.dev)

## My current Projects are:
### [urReader](https://github.com/YuriVGR/urRead) (may change the name later)

An open source and modular manga reader built on react native, everything is being built from scratch, so it will probably take some time until it's first alpha version.
